# Engineering Resilient Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP)
### A Cross-Domain Framework for High-Frequency, High-Volatility Data Environments

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains the technical foundation for my PhD research (TalTech, 2026). It implements a **Resilient Reproducible Analytical Pipeline (RAP)** designed to operate across multiple high-frequency data environments, including:

- **Pricing telemetry** (web-scraped economic indicators)  
- **Sports telemetry** (IMU/GPS/HR/HRV data)  
- **Clinical telemetry** (FHIR/HL7 physiological streams)

The framework demonstrates how a **domain-agnostic ingestion architecture** can be adapted to volatile, schema-drifting, or safety-critical environments through modular adapters and reproducible engineering principles.

Originally conceived as a “self-healing” web scraper for National Statistical Offices (NSOs), the project has evolved into a **generalizable pipeline-engineering framework** validated across multiple operational domains.

## 📄 Abstract

National Statistical Offices, sports performance teams, and clinical monitoring systems all face a common challenge: **high-frequency data pipelines break easily** when upstream schemas drift, sensors fail, or interfaces change.

Traditional pipelines rely on brittle selectors, rigid schemas, or domain-specific assumptions. When these fail, organizations experience **data blackouts**, delayed decision-making, and loss of situational awareness.

This research proposes a **Resilient RAP Framework** grounded in:

- **Software reliability engineering** (Pareto-focused resilience)  
- **Tamper-evident processing** (auditability and lineage)  
- **Cross-domain generalizability** (pricing → sports → clinical)  
- **Reproducibility** (deterministic outputs across environments)

The framework introduces a **domain-agnostic ingestion interface** (`BaseIngestor`) and a set of **domain adapters** that implement environment-specific extraction, validation, and normalization logic. This enables a single architecture to operate across volatile, heterogeneous, or safety-critical data sources.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

The system is structured as a modular, extensible RAP:

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|----------|------------|---------|
| **Core Ingestion Interface** | Python (`BaseIngestor`) | Domain-agnostic ingestion contract (connect → extract → parse → validate → normalize) |
| **Pricing Adapter** | BeautifulSoup, regex | Extracting semi-structured pricing signals from web pages |
| **Sports Adapter** | JSON APIs, pandas | Ingesting IMU/GPS/HR/HRV telemetry from athlete monitoring systems |
| **Clinical Adapter** | FHIR/HL7 APIs | Ingesting physiological observations from clinical telemetry systems |
| **Resilience Layer** | Logging, lineage, error capture | Ensuring fault tolerance and traceability |
| **Reproducibility** | Docker, pinned dependencies | Guaranteeing deterministic execution across years |

This architecture supports the PhD’s three-paper structure:

1. **Sports telemetry application paper**  
2. **Clinical telemetry application paper**  
3. **Unified pipeline-engineering framework paper**

## 🧠 Theoretical Foundations

This framework draws on three major research streams:

### **Autonomous Agents**
Adapting “believable agent” logic to navigate semi-structured environments and infer signal relevance from context rather than fixed selectors.

### **Software Reliability Engineering**
Applying Pareto-focused resilience: reinforcing the “vital few” failure points that cause the majority of pipeline outages.

### **Data Integrity & Reproducibility**
Implementing tamper-evident lineage, deterministic transformations, and reproducible environments to ensure long-term auditability.
